## Configuration

### Request Rate Limiting
The application includes configurable request rates to avoid API rate limiting:

**Backend (proxy_server.py):**
```python
REQUESTS_PER_SECOND = 5  # Adjust this value (recommended: 3-10)
```

**Frontend (trading-calculator.js):**
```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    BATCH_SIZE: 5,           // Items processed simultaneously
    BATCH_DELAY: 200,        // Delay between batches (ms)
    ITEM_DELAY: 200,         // Delay between items (ms)
    MAX_OPPORTUNITIES: 20    // Max results to show
};
```

**Speed Tuning Guide:**
- **Conservative:** 3 requests/second (recommended for server safety)
- **Balanced:** 5 requests/second (current setting, maximum safe limit)
- **Aggressive:** 10+ requests/second (may trigger rate limits)

## Authentication Details

The authentication system uses the Warframe Market v1 API:
- **JWT-based authentication** with automatic token refresh
- **Session management** with 1-hour validity
- **Secure credential handling** - credentials are not stored locally
- **CORS handling** through the proxy server

**Note:** Authentication is currently independent of the trading features. Logged-in sessions may be used for future authenticated API calls.

---

## Rate Limiting Protection

The application includes comprehensive rate limiting protection:
- **Real-time detection** of HTTP 429 responses
- **Visual warnings** when rate limited
- **Automatic throttling** to prevent rate limit triggers
- **Countdown timers** showing estimated wait times
- **Button disabling** during rate limit periods

---

## Limitations & Known Issues

- **No Order Creation:** This tool does not create or manage orders on Warframe.market
- **Some Orders Missing:** Some orders visible on the Warframe.market website (notably those with a special icon next to the profile picture) may not appear in this app. These orders are not present in the public API and cannot be fetched programmatically
- **API Rate Limits:** The tool is rate-limited to avoid being blocked by Warframe.market. Large scans may take several minutes
- **Data Freshness:** Results are only as fresh as the public API allows. Some stale orders may appear if not yet purged from the API
- **Authentication Scope:** Currently, authentication is separate from trading features. Future updates may integrate authenticated API calls

## Project Structure (Refactored)

- `backend/` ‚Äî Python backend code (auth_handler.py, proxy_server.py)
- `frontend/` ‚Äî All frontend code
    - `index.html`, `login.html`, `trading-calculator.html`
    - `js/` ‚Äî JavaScript files
    - `css/` ‚Äî CSS files
